# RPG-Unity-Adventure

This is a home project, inspired from a C++ textEdit game that I created when I took my first C++ programming class. 

From there I wanted to bring that textEdit game to life in Unity. 

Only scripts are uploaded here. Graphics, Sounds, and everything else are stored somewhere else.
