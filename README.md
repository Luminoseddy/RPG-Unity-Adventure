# RPG-Unity-Adventure

This is a home project, inspired from a C++ textEdit game that I created when I took my first C++ programming class. 

TextEdit Game script::  https://github.com/PalermoX/textRPG

From there I wanted to bring the TextEdit game to life in Unity. 

Only scripts are uploaded here. Graphics, Sounds, and everything else are stored somewhere else.
